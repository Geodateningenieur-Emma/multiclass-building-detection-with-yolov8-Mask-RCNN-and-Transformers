Buildings can vary significantly in size, shape, material, or usage and values.
Multi-class building detection refers to the process of detecting and classifying buildings into multiple categories, typically based on their attributes or characteristics. 
This is an advanced step beyond binary building detection (which simply identifies buildings as a single class) and has several practical applications, particularly in areas like urban planning, and development assessemnt.
